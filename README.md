MVVM stands for Model View View-model it provides the separation of development of the graphical user interface(GUI) from the business logic or back-end logic (or data model). The view model of MVVM is a converter that converts the data from the model in such a way that it can be managed and presented with great ease. So we could say that the view model is more model rather than a view as it handles most of the view's logic and it even makes the code very readable.

The Boilerplate contains the minimal implementation required to create a new library or project. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants and required dependencies to create a new project. By using boiler plate code as standard initializer, we can have same patterns in all the projects that will inherit it. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.
